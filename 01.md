## **Learning outcomes**

* Learn about what are components, services and modules and how to create them
* Learn what are presentational/pure and container/stateful components
* Learn about the basics of how to unit test Angular components and Observables
* Learn how to pass information between parent and child component
* Learn how to create a template-driven and reactive forms in Angular
* Learn how to validate forms synchronously and asynchronously
* Learn what an Observable is and how to test it using marble syntax and `jasmine-marbles` library
  
&nbsp;

## **Learning steps for first learning path**

1. Add `@angular/material` to your project (`material.angular.io`) and import `auth` and `mock-api` modules to `app.module.ts`.
2. Create a `core` module in `src/app/core` that imports `MatToolbarModule` and `MatButtonModule`. Import `core` module into the `app` module.
3. Create a header component in `src/app/core/components/header/`. It has the following requirements:
    * contains a `mat-toolbar` from `@angular/material/toolbar` package
    * has an `@Input()` properties `title` and `isLoggedIn`
    * displays `h1` level application title and a `Logout` button when the user is logged in inside the toolbar
    * the button and title have to be at the opposite sides of the toolbar
    * it is exported from `core` module
    * it is displayed at the width of the browser window in `app` component
4. Add a login form (create a template-driven form) to `app-login` component. It has the following requirements:
    * `username` and `password` form fields (use angular Material form field component)
    * `Log in` button (use Angular Material button component)
    * implement the following validation rules:
      * `username` is required
      * `password` is required
      * `Log in` button has to be disabled when form is invalid
5. Add a signup form (create a reactive form) to `app-sign-up` component. It has the following requirements:
    * `@Output()` property `signupRequested`. Event is emitted when user clicks `Sign up` button.
    * `@Output()` property `isValidUsername`. Event is emitted every `250ms` when user types into the form field.
    * `username`, `password` and `confirm password` fields (use Angular Material form field component)
    * `Sign up` button (use Angular Material button component)
    * It has to implement following validation rules:
        * given username does not exist (validate against `mock-api`)
        * provided passwords have to match
        * username has to be at least 4 characters long
        * password has to be at least 6 characters long and contain a number
6. Implement the following functionality in `app-auth` component:
    * has to initially display `app-login` component with a `or sign up` button
    * when sign-up button is clicked the `app-login` view is replaced by `app-sign-up` view
    * when `app-login` component emits `loginRequested` event the login request is sent to `mock-api` via `auth` service
    * when `app-sign-up` component emits `signupRequested` event the signup request is sent to `mock-api` via `auth` service
    * when `app-sign-up` component emits `isValidUserename` event the username is validated from `mock-api`
    * when request fails, catch the error and log to the console (notifying user when request fail will come later on). You have to create `signup` method in auth service.
